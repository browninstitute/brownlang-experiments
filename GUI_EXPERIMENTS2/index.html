                <br>GUI Expriments Part II</h1>
            After a few experiments on the language part of the project (see <a href="../LANG_EXPERIMENTS1.pdf">here</a>), and two others on how to adapt literary notation to programming interface (see <a href="../GUI_EXPERIMENTS1/test1.html">here</a> and <a href="../GUI_EXPERIMENTS1/test2.html">here</a>), I wanted to go deeper on the "programmy" part. To put it differently, what tools could be much more useful for novice programmers, regardless of the langage used? 
            <br><br>I made a few in-browser experiments to simulate 
            what a few of these tools would look like with Python programs. 
            In each example, I used a snippet of code, 
            assuming it was typed by the user. Generally, there is a
            <img src="examples/plus.png"> or a 
            <img src="examples/compute.png"> located next to this snippet. 
            By clicking on each of them, the user can see the code in a different,
            often more tangible way.
            <br><br>Only 6 experiments are fully finished now. 
            I have 3 more in my head. However, when it comes to make
            small tools to make programming more tangible, the field seems almost
            infinite.
