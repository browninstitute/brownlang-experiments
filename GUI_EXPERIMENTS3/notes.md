# GUI_EXPERIMENTS 3
Other notes:
- This is a very basic and dumb implementation.
  It does not support variable scope and a lot of different other stuff. 
- It also does not work with any code whose depiction on the screen 
  is longer that what your screeen can handle.
- Do NOT write loops by hand. Copy and paste them. 
  More often than not, one iteration of your code will be an infinite
  loop, and will freeze the browser. I have not yet come with a proper
  implementation of infinite loop detector, but that may come.*/
